    <h1>My Pet-Muren</h1>
    <img src="Muren.JPG"
    <p>Muren is my dog.Can you see him?Doesn't he look nice?No?I think he's swell.He is a Boerboel,a South African mastff(large dog breed.)
    I got Muren four years ago.Although he is essentially a guard dog,Boerboels like Muren are actully
    loving dogs,good with children and very protective.<p/>
    <p>Muren is an odd dog name I know,I picked this name because it means <em>warrior</em>
    in my language-Suk(read Pokot).</p>
    <p>Muren is a very strong dog and had to be trained in obedience.He likes taking long walks
    and running around the house,playing with me and my nephews.He has an old blanket which  also serves as his toy.I feel that
    Muren sometimes seems lonely so I plan to get a girlfriend for him!Maybe one day he can have a son or daughter like him.</p><img src="puppy.jpg"><p>Isn't he cute?That's all for now.Bye!</p><br/>
